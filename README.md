# GraphQL Kimera

Kimera is an automocking library for GraphQL that allows you to be very precise about how mocks should be generated.

## Why?

Kimera is useful to:

- **Speed up the prototyping process**. It's very easy to get a mocked server up and running by just updating the schema definition and optionally customizing the mocks providers.
- **Allow large teams to better coordinate**. Frontend developers can negotiate changes to the schema with the backend developers and then quickly add mocks for the changes in a Kimera mocked version of the server while the backend team gets to implmenting the changes.
- **Improve testing in front end applications that use GraphQL**. Using Kimera allows one to customize query responses by defining _a single scenario_ as opposed to exhaustively mocking each query response, which is extremely useful for large component trees where queries are used at different levels of the component hierarchy.

## Getting Started

To install Kimera you can install it via `npm` or `yarn`, it's totally up to you. We're guessing that you'll most likely want Kimera to be a dev dependency.

```
npm install --save-dev @lola-tech/graphql-kimera
```

or if you want to use yarn

```
yarn add --dev @lola-tech/graphql-kimera
```

### Examples

These examples assume the use of the [example schema we are using for testing](https://github.com/lola-tech/graphql-kimera/blob/master/packages/graphql-kimera/src/__test__/example.schema.graphql).

#### Basic Example

Running the `rockets` query will return four rockets, all of type `Shuttle`, with the first being called `Apollo`.

```js
const { getExecutableSchema } = require("@lola-tech/graphql-kimera")

// Importing the typeDefs from the `schema.graphql` file...

const executableSchema = getExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  mockProvividersFn: () => ({
    scenario: {
      rockets: [{ name: "Apollo" }, {}, {}, {}],
    },
    builders: {
      Rocket: () => ({
        type: "Shuttle",
      }),
    },
  },
});

const apollo = new ApolloServer({
  schema: executableSchema,
  introspection: true,
  port: 4000,
});

apollo.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(chalk.green.bold(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`));
});
```

#### Custom query resolvers examples

If you want to implement filtering in the mocked `rockets` query, you can define
a resolver uing the `useResolver` function.

```js
const {
  getExecutableSchema,
  useResolver
} = require("@lola-tech/graphql-kimera")

// Importing the typeDefs from the `schema.graphql` file...

const executableSchema = getExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  mockProvividersFn: () => ({
    scenario: {
      rockets: useResolver(
        // Define a resolver factory
        mocks => (_, { type }) => {
          // mocks is a store that contains the mocks for the `rockets` query
          const rockets = mocks.get();
          return type ? rockets.filter(rocket => rocket.type === type) : rockets;
        },
        // Optionally define a node scenario
        [{}, { type: "Starship" }, { type: "Starship" }, {}],
      ),
    },
    builders: {
      Rocket: () => ({
        type: "Shuttle",
      }),
    },
  },
});

// Starting your server using the above defined executable schema ....
```

#### Mutations resolvers example

```js
const {
  getExecutableSchema,
} = require("@lola-tech/graphql-kimera")

// Importing the typeDefs from the `schema.graphql` file...

const executableSchema = getExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  mutationResolversFn: (store, buildMocks) => ({
    // Example of how you would use buildMocks to build a node of a specific
    // type. If the Rocket `type` is omitted from the `input`, the `Shuttle`
    // value defined in the `Rocket` builder is used.
    createRocket: (_, { input }) => {
      let newRocket = null;
      // Example of mocking the unhappy path
      if (input.name !== "Fail") {
        newRocket = buildMocks("Rocket", { ...input }, true);
        store.update({ rockets: [...store.get("rockets"), newRocket] });
      }

      return {
        successful: input.name !== "Fail",
        rockets: store.get("rockets"),
      };
    },
  },
});

// Starting your server using the above defined executable schema ....
```
