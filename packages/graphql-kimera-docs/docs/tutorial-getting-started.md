Setting up a GraphQL server with an [executable schema](/graphql-kimera/docs/glossary#executable-schema) generated by GraphQL Kimera

We'll use [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) for the server, but Apollo Server could work just as well. In order to start the server, we first need to have Kimera build an executable schema.

```javascript
const { GraphQLServer } = require('graphql-yoga');
const { getExecutableSchema } = require('graphql-kimera');

const typeDefs = `
type City {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  population: Int
}

type Query {
  city: City
}

schema {
  query: Query
}
`;

const executableSchema = getExecutableSchema(typeDefs);

const server = new GraphQLServer({ schema: executableSchema });
server.start(() => console.log('Server is running on localhost:4000'));
```

Running this code with `node` will start a server on `localhost:4000`. Visiting the URL will predictably take us to the GraphQL Playground.

Running the `city` query...

```graphql
query {
  city {
    id
    name
    population
  }
}
```

...will yield data based on the defaults for Built-in Scalar Types described in the [Scalar Type Builders](/graphql-kimera/docs/scalar-type-builders).

```json
{
  "data": {
    "city": {
      "id": "irg5btv90",
      "name": "GENERATED_STRING",
      "population": 695
    }
  }
}
```
