GraphQL Kimera is an automocking library that allows you to be very precise about how mocks should be generated.

## Getting Started

To install Kimera you can install it via `npm` or `yarn`, it's totally up to you.

```
npm install --save-dev kimera
```

or if you want to use yarn

```
yarn add kimera --dev
```

### Example

```js
const {
  getExecutableSchema,
  useResolver,
} = require("@lola-tech/graphql-mirage")

// ...

const executableSchema = getExecutableSchema(
  typeDefs,
  () => ({
  scenario: {
    rockets: [{name: "Apollo", }, {}, {}, {}],
  },
  builders: {
    Rocket: () => ({
      type: "Shuttle",
    }),
  },
},
);

const apollo = new ApolloServer({
  schema: executableSchema,
  introspection: true,
  port: 4000,
});

apollo.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(chalk.green.bold(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`));
});
```

Running the `rockets` query will return four rockets, all of `Shuttle` type, with the first being called `Apollo`.
